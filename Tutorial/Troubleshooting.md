# Problems

* Unable to clone git

  * Solution: Create a Personal Access Token. Instructions here: https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/creating-a-personal-access-token

* If downloading a zip:

  * creates a main folder called ClusteredCollapsing-main
    * Solution: Rename folder to ClusteredCollapsing and make it only one folder deep

* Removed executable permission from all files 
    * Solution: Do 'chmod +x ./ClusteredCollapsing/Scripts/*' to add executable permission to all files in Scripts folder
